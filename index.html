    Rumors thruought the global SuperUman community indicate a small underground sub sect have
    drawn up a proposl for new legislation regarding the ban of any and all members of the community.<br>
    This comes in the midst of a rather unwarranted decision to ban Hagz, a prominent figure and former <br>
    campaign leader from the SuperUMAn Discord community. This proposal is stated to be inadvertently delivered in a community call
    on Tuesday July 20th. This declaration will include a pardon for Mr. Hagz and a new bill, appropriately titled "The Hagz Bill" to passed into UMAn law delegating any
    and all punishment and or consequences to the SuperUMANs to decide justification and action for unacceptable behavior.
    The submitted proposal would allow for community vote and appeal process if needed or acquired for any ban or removal.
    This was drafted and expected to be announced by FruityCupp in a "shock and aww" type of delivery. Demanding the immediate overturn of
    the Hagz ban This proposed bill shall include new rules, regulations, consequences and procedures to enact on such unforeseen situations.
